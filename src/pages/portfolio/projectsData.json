    "description": "This was a dream project. I am in the 395th Army Band and serve as a senior leader and platoon sergeant. Communication is key in the unit because we only meet once a month and two weekends over the summer. I created this app to serve as a quick reference for important documents, announcements, and contact info. I also implemented a task manager for admins that allows for adding/editing/deleting tasks and assigning them to specific Soldiers, which then populates in their `My Tasks` screen. This was my first time working with React Native/Expo and it was a lot of fun and I learned a lot about the simple, yet powerful framework that is React Native.",

I made my own API, hosted on AWS (frontend is S3, API Gateway then calls a Lambda function). Users can add/edit/delete crops from the API that only they create, except for admins - who can add/edit/delete anything. Each crop displays germination/harvest time as well as a brief description. I had a lot of fun with this project and learned a lot about React and just how powerful and responsive it can be.",
